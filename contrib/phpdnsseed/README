PHP script to extract seednodes from
a running daemon en put them in a format
suitable for bind.

Caveat: only IPV4 is supported at this moment.


Config hints (replace example.com by your domain...):

Run this script with cron, say every 10 minutes.

Pipe the output to /etc/bind/db.i0seed.example.com

Add the following to named.conf.local:
----
zone "i0seed.example.com" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.i0seed.snel.it";
        allow-query { any; };
};
----

You must "/etc/init.d/bind9 reload" after every update.

Now a lookup of i0seed.example.com results in the latest
connectable nodes.
